# Shopify Frontend Internship Challenge ⚠️ In Progress

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, React.js, Node.js, Express, Styled-Components, Polaris components, Axios, OMDB API

## Lessons Learned:
- Spent a good amount of time understanding useState and how it works within a React app.
- How to pass and handle data between frontend and backend. In this project, I had to pass data from the search bar to the backend to make an API call, then have the results return to the frontend to appear on the app.
