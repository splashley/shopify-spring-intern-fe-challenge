// MY NOTES //

- ReactJS, Node.js, Axios, 

- challenges
 - figuring out the libraries/framework I was going to use
 - thinking about how to safely make an api call without exposing the apikey

 - express, cors, body-parser, morgan


// REQUIREMENTS //

We'd like a simple to use interface that makes it easy to:
- Search OMDB and display the results (movies only)
- Add a movie from the search results to our nomination list
- View the list of films already nominated
- Remove a nominee from the nomination list

Technical requirements
- Search results should come from OMDB's API (free API key: http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx).
- Each search result should list at least its title, year of release and a button to nominate that film.
- Updates to the search terms should update the result list
- Movies in search results can be added and removed from the nomination list.
- If a search result has already been nominated, disable its nominate button.
- Display a banner when the user has 5 nominations.
